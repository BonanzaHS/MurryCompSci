Screen - GNU mutliplexor for command-line

Screen basics
    Screen allows for users to simultaneously run multiple terminal sessions
    Screen acts like it's any other terminal, but with the press of C-a, everything become a screen command
    Every screen command-line option has a corresponding screen shortcut

Screen Default Commands
    *Screen commands are prefaced with *THE* control character (C-a)  followed by a SINGLE key sroke
    *Therefore, screen commands have two key presses, but the 2nd determines which screen option is executed
    screen -list listing out all the current screen sessions 
    *screen default key configuration
