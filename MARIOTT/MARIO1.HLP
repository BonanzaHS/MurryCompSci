<12>Main Menu Help
<1>
From the Main Menu, you may select
the different play modes available.
The right edge of the screen lists
the various modes of play.  They
are:

	Outside (Beginner) World
	Underwater (Intermediate) World
	Underground (Advanced) World
	Practice (Expert Express)
	Report Card (View Progress)
	Next (Go To Next Lesson)

If you have loaded a student, then
[NEXT] is your best option, as it
will sequence you through the
lessons at a rate acceptable to
you, allowing you to maximize
your learning of the typing
skills.

If you are not ready for a world,
you must first set your goal WPM
high enough to qualify for that
world, as follows:

	Outside		No minimum
	Underwater	10 wpm minimum
	Underground	30 wpm minimum
	Practice	No minimum

To set your goal WPM artificially,
select Edit from the Student menu,
after a student has first been
loaded.
