~Our solar system is made up of nine planets and one star, the sun.`  The closest planet to the sun is Mercury.`  After Mercury is Venus then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and the most distant planet is Pluto.`  The largest planet, Jupiter, is about 1000 times larger than the Earth.`  The Earth is 93 million miles away from the sun.`  At that distance it takes the light that leaves the sun approximately eight minutes to reach the surface of the Earth.`  It takes Jupiter about 12 years to circle the sun.`  In other words, one Jupiter year is equivalent to 12 years here on Earth.`
