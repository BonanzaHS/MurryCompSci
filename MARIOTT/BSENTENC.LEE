~The National Football League (NFL) was founded in the 1920's.`  In the 1960's a league calling itself the American Football League (AFL) emerged as a competitor to the established NFL.`  In 1970 the two leagues merged and became two conferences (the NFC and the AFC) which today have 14 teams each.`  At the end of each season the champions of each conference meet in a game called the Super Bowl.` 
The first Super Bowl was played in January of 1967 when the Green Bay Packers beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-10.`  The Packers won the 2nd Super Bowl also, beating the Oakland Raiders.`

~The San Francisco 49ers are a football team in the NFC.`  In the 1980's they won four Super Bowls led by their star quarterback Joe Montana (who wears the #16 on his jersey).`  They first were in the Super Bowl in 1982 when they beat the Cincinnati Bengals 26-21.`  In 1985 they beat the Miami Dolphins by a score of 38-16.`  In 1989 the 49ers played the Bengals again in Super Bowl 23, and on a last second touchdown pass from Montana to John Taylor (#82) they won 20-16.`  The following year the 49ers won again, this time crushing the AFC champion Denver Broncos 55-10.`

~In 1961, Roger Maris of the New York Yankees hit 61 homeruns in a single season, breaking Babe Ruth's record.`  It was a record that many people thought would never be broken.`  Since 1961 no one has come close to surpassing Maris' feat.`  In fact only a handful of players have hit 50.`  In 1977 the Reds' George Foster hit 52.`  In 1987 many felt that Oakland A's rookie sensation Mark McGwire had a chance to beat Maris' record when he had 33 homeruns by the All-Star break.`  However McGwire's pace could not continue as he finished the season with 49.`  In 1990 Detroit's Cecil Fielder hit 51.`
