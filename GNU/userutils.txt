Common User related commands
    # In an interactive shell, the currently logged on user directs commands to
    # the shell interpreter to execute. Every command at the command line must
    # begin with the name of a program located in one of the $PATH directories.
    # After a program name, optional or mandatory options can be given to the
    # selected program to modify it's behavior.

    # User commands and their effects are restricted by file permissions
    # Each file has associated metadata that defines which permissions # are
granted to the file owner, file group, and all other users.
